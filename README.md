# Hu-Shing algorithm implemenation
This project includes C++ implementation of Hu-Shing algorithm, which solves Matrix Chain Ordering Problem(MCOP) in O(nlogn) time.

## Matrix Chain Product Problem
Given a sequence of matrices, the goal is to find an optimum order of multiplication to minimize the number of scalar computations.

## Usage
You can see the implementation and usage in hu-shing.cpp.
